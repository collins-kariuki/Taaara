Retail stores, commonly referred to as supermarkets in Kenya, are a core part of an urban community. A majority of the goods purchased by urban area dwellers are from these stores and their presence in major shopping Centers in the country goes further to prove their significance.

As a result of the continued increase of shoppers visiting these stores, long queues have continued to riddle supermarkets and retail stores that use a traditional cashier operated Point Of Sale systems. To the disgruntlement of the store owners, long queues have become a pain to many customers at major retail outlets. A quick visit to any of the retail stores in the capital to purchase a bottle of soda in the evening will have you queuing for close to twenty minutes awaiting your opportunity to get served by the often-tired cashier. This leaves you with the wish for a faster and more convenient mode of payment.

A Self-checkout mechanism is proposed to try and overcome this problem. the objective of this project is to develop a smart cart that will enable customers to scan and bag items while shopping.  This will enable the decentralization of the goods payment process thus reducing the time required to obtain the service.
